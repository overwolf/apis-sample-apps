This app contains one desktop window with an ad. When this window is hidden or minimized, the ad is removed.

Plans for the next release:
---------------------------
1. Opacity - we usually prefer that the ad will not be effected by opacity change, just the rest of the app content.
2. Add Tabs - it will be good example that the user is moving between tabs and the ad keeps playing. (there are devs that refresh the ad and that's wrong)
